# Alfred AI Version 5

Version 5 is currently in development, It will be constructed using React.js and use the electron framework.  
This will improve the visuals of the app, as well as allow for more cross platform usage.

This will be a considerable rewrite as I will need to rewrite the Neural Network in Javascript, as well as intergrate OpenAi's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 Depending on the availability

This will be a learning experience as I have little to no Javascript experience ;-)

Cheers
