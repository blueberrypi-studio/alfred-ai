# Alfred AI Version 4

Version 4 is designed to be a test for the openai GPT models, and intergrating them into my projects.  
This is the javascript evolution of version 3. This version will not have a release, but can be compiled from source if required. Version 5 is the next planned release, so check [releases](https://github.com/blueberrypi-studio/alfred-ai/releases) to stay up to date.
